# Vitaran वितरण

Vitaran is a blockchain-based food delivery system that enables restaurants to make deliveries without sharing any revenue with anyone. Unlike in swiggy/zomato, restaurant owners do not share their revenue with Vitaran. Instead, restaurants and customers pre-decide how much they are willing to pay to the squad boy directly. And the squad boy decides if he/she wants to take this delivery. No intermediary. More business. With ethics.

This project is envisaged to be a food delivery system that has below advantages over the current systems:

1. Restaurants and Customers do not need to pay us for using Vitaran. They directly pay to the squad boy an amount pre-decided by them.
2. Completely distributed on-ground delivery squad. Our biggest weakness (of entering late) is also the biggest advantage we have (existing delivery boys and restaurants who are pissed at Swiggy / Zomato)
3. Extremely low and FIXED delivery charges for customers and restaurants. Restaurants and customers can be asked to pay fixed charges directly to the squad boy; based on the distance for the delivery or other parameters. 
4. A trustworthy delivery squad who are happy to work. Since we are putting the squad in control, they are the one who decides if they want to take that delivery or not! For someone, Rs 40/delivery is a matter of putting food for the family on the table.
5. COMPLETELY FREE SERVICE! We should try to have the Vitaran service completely free for all three stakeholders forever! We make money (even if it is a little less) from ethically managed ads and optionally add-on services.
6. A blockchain-based system allows customers to have a complete history of restaurants and the squad boy. Later, this service can be given to restaurants as well. Because knowledge is power!
7. Proudly Indian! No Chinese hanky-panky stuff!
