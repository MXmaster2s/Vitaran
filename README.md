Blockchain-based Food Delivery System From India

This project is envisaged to be a food delivery system that has below advantages over the current systems:
1. No revenue sharing for restaurants. We charge 0% for the delivery services. Period.
2. Completely distributed on-ground delivery squad (team of delivery boys)
3. Extremely low and FIXED delivery charges for customers and restaurants (no matter if the bill is Rs. 100 or Rs. 1000!)
4. Trustworthy delivery squad who are happy to work (unlike unethical behaviours like Swiggy / Zomato)
5. COMPLETELY FREE SERVICE FOREVER! For restaurants, customers and delivery boys! 
6. Know the restaurant who is cooking, where the raw materials are coming from and who is your delivery boy. Because, knowledge is power!
7. Proudly Indian! No Chinese hanky-panky stuff!
